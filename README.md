# IdolsBot
 
## Creating necessary files
You need to create one .env file to be able to launch the bot with the application you created on [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
This file must be named *.env* and placed in *src/* folder. It should contains one line with the bot token.
### Example 
```
# .env file
BOT_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
